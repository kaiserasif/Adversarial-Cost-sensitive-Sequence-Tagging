Related code for Adversarial Cost-sensitive Classification [(paper)](https://kaiserasif.github.io/papers/asif2015uai.pdf) and Adversarial Sequence Tagging [(paper)](https://kaiserasif.github.io/papers/li2016adversarial.pdf). This is not the original codes used in the papers. However, it provides a python version. 

Sequence Tagging code is more matured and an experiment is provided in _hapt_experiment_ (unpublished work).
