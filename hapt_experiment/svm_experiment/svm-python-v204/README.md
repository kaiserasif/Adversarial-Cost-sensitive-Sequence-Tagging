## SVM<sup>_struct_</sup> with python interface (SVM<sup>_python_</sup>)
This code was developed by [Thomas Finley](http://tfinley.net/software/svmpython2/). <br>

Here we do _Sequence Tagging_ with _Cost-matrix_. 

#### Notes:
- Python 2 needed (python 3 doesn't work)
- Apple gcc worked (clang-1000.10.44.4)

- __Edit Makefile__ to include the right module. --m option didn't work. Cannot find module in the path. 
- Once module is linked, it can be subsequently edited, including adding or removing optional function, without rebuilding again.
